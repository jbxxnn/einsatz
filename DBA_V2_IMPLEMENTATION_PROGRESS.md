# DBA V2 Implementation Progress

## Overview
We are implementing a complete redesign of the DBA (Declaration of Labor Relations) system to align with Dutch methodology. The new system presents the same 35 questions to both clients and freelancers from their respective perspectives, then compares answers to detect disputes.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Database Schema & Structure
- **Core Tables Created:**
  - `dba_question_groups` - Contains the 35 Dutch-compliant questions
  - `dba_question_disputes` - Stores disputes between client/freelancer answers
  - `dba_dispute_messages` - Tracks dispute resolution conversations
  - `dba_booking_dispute_summary` - Summary of disputes per booking
  - Updated `bookings` table with dispute-related fields

- **Question Structure:**
  - 35 standardized questions covering all Dutch DBA requirements
  - Questions are audience-targeted (client vs freelancer perspective)
  - Multiple-choice answer format
  - Proper categorization and grouping

### 2. Frontend Components
- **DBA Questionnaire V2** (`components/dba-questionnaire-v2.tsx`)
  - Handles both client and freelancer audiences
  - Dynamic question presentation based on user type
  - Answer validation and storage

- **DBA Warning Dialog** (`components/dba-warning-dialog.tsx`)
  - Custom React dialog replacing browser confirm()
  - Professional UI for DBA status warnings
  - Integrated into booking flow

- **Job Offerings Manager** (`components/job-offerings-manager.tsx`)
  - Integrated DBA V2 completion directly into job offerings
  - Status indicators (V2 Complete, Not Started)
  - Context-aware buttons (Start DBA, Update DBA)
  - Drag-and-drop reordering with `@dnd-kit`

### 3. API Endpoints
- **DBA Status Check** (`/api/dba/check-freelancer-status`)
  - Checks freelancer DBA completion status
  - Returns appropriate status for booking flow
  - Handles both V1 and V2 compatibility

- **DBA Report Generation V2** (`/api/dba/reports/generate-v2`)
  - Generates DBA reports with comparison-based scoring
  - Detects and stores disputes
  - Updates booking status based on dispute detection

### 4. Booking Flow Integration

  - Validates freelancer DBA status before allowing booking
  - Shows appropriate warnings for incomplete DBA
  - Prevents booking for freelancers without DBA

- **DBA Completion During Booking**
  - Clients complete DBA questionnaire during booking process
  - Answers are stored and linked to the specific booking
  - Integration with dispute detection system

### 5. Database Migrations & Fixes
- **Schema Updates:**
  - Added `display_order` to job offerings for drag-and-drop
  - Fixed V2 table structure with proper constraints
  - Added unique constraints for conflict resolution
  - Cleaned corrupted DBA data

- **RLS Policy Fixes:**
  - Updated policies to allow proper access for status checks
  - Fixed client access to freelancer DBA data
  - Ensured freelancer data privacy

### 6. Additional Features
- **Subcategory Filtering**
  - Hierarchical category/subcategory filtering for freelancers
  - Dynamic subcategory display based on selected category
  - Enhanced search and filtering capabilities

- **Wildcard Badge System**
  - Added wildcard badge next to verified badge
  - Proper internationalization support
  - Enhanced freelancer profile display

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### 1. Dispute Detection Logic
- **Current Status:** Partially implemented in report generation
- **What's Working:** Basic dispute detection and storage
- **What's Missing:** Comprehensive scoring algorithm and dispute categorization

## ‚ùå REMAINING TO IMPLEMENT

### 1. Scoring Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Comparison-based Algorithm:**
  - Compare client vs freelancer answers for each question
  - Calculate discrepancy scores
  - Identify critical vs minor disputes
  - Generate overall compliance percentage

- **Scoring Rules:**
  - Define which answer combinations constitute disputes
  - Weight different question types (critical vs informational)
  - Handle partial matches and edge cases

### 2. Dispute Resolution System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Freelancer Acceptance Flow:**
  - Block freelancer from accepting booking if disputes exist
  - Require dispute resolution before acceptance
  - Show dispute summary and resolution interface

- **Dispute Resolution Interface:**
  - Create UI for both parties to resolve disputes
  - Allow freelancer to update answers
  - Track resolution progress and deadlines
  - Send notifications for dispute updates

- **Post-Booking Dispute Handling:**
  - Implement dispute escalation process
  - Add dispute status tracking
  - Handle dispute resolution deadlines

### 3. Enhanced Notifications
- **Dispute Notifications:**
  - Notify freelancers of new disputes
  - Alert clients of dispute resolution progress
  - Send reminders for pending disputes

- **Status Updates:**
  - Real-time dispute status updates
  - Booking status changes based on dispute resolution
  - Progress tracking for dispute resolution

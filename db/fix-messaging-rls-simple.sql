-- Fix Messaging RLS with Simple Approach
-- This completely avoids recursion by simplifying the policy structure

-- First, drop ALL existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view conversations they participate in" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update conversations they participate in" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in conversations they participate in" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages in conversations they participate in" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view conversation participants for conversations they participate in" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert conversation participants" ON conversation_participants;

-- Temporarily disable RLS on conversation_participants to break the circular dependency
ALTER TABLE conversation_participants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create very simple policies that don't reference conversation_participants
-- For conversations: allow authenticated users to access
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to access conversations" ON conversations
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- For messages: allow authenticated users to access
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to access messages" ON messages
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Keep the existing grants
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON conversations TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON messages TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON conversation_participants TO authenticated;

-- Grant execute permissions on the functions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION create_or_get_conversation(UUID, UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION add_message(UUID, UUID, TEXT) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_conversations(UUID) TO authenticated;
